/**
 * In the event your application relies on color names that have been deprecated, 
 * use this theme to restore the deprecated color names.
 * The following theme has transitional properties to 
 * mitigate the upgrade to the design-system theme, i.e. migrating from hpe
 * theme version ^1.0.0 to ^2.0.0
 * Using the v2migration interim theme support will help you avoid critical
 * and immediate breaking changes.
 *
 * How does it work?
 * After upgrading your official HPE theme to point to the new HPE
 * design-system theme 2.0.0 (via your package.json), 
 * copy the content of this file to your local theme file. 
 * Copying the content of this file will help you avoid immediate
 * breaking changes behavior (such as undefined colors)
 * However the main goal is for your theme to work independently without
 * this interim theme support.

**Breaking Change:**  
Removed the following colors from the theme:

- `decorative-red`
- `red`
- `red!`
- `decorative-orange`
- `orange`
- `orange!`
- `decorative-yellow`
- `yellow`
- `yellow!`
- `decorative-teal`
- `teal`
- `teal!`

These colors are no longer supported and should be replaced with other theme colors.

Added `decorative-cyan` color to the theme.

Adjusted the prism theme colors for use with code blocks syntax highlighting.

Adjusted heading font sizes so that `xxsmall`, `xsmall`, `small`, `large`, and `xlarge` stay consistent across all heading levels.

xxsmall = 14px (exported as em)
xsmall = 16px (exported as em)
small = 18px (exported as em)
large = 24px (exported as em)
xlarge = 32px (exported as em)

Changed to new typeface, Graphik, which replaces HPE Metric.
